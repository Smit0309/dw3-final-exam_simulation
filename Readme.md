  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE products (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  price DECIMAL(10,2),
  image_path VARCHAR(255),
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```
